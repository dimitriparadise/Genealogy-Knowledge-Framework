Welcome to Genealogy Knowledge Framework

This framework aims to fill the research gap by providing a systematic process guidance for practitioners seeking to uncover the hidden knowledge from genealogy.

The framework could automatically discover the hidden knowledge by association rule and visualize the knowledge graph in a web interface. Our contributions are mainly in:
(1) creating an integrated framework for knowledge reasoning and visualization applications based on knowledge graphs.
(2) optimizing the knowledge inference and knowledge complementation methods.
(3) realizing the dynamic mutual promotion of users and resources from the perspective of user experience with visualization technology

To verify the reliability and practicality of the proposed framework, we take Manchu genealogy as the experimental data to show how to construct and visualize a genealogical knowledge graph from raw data. 

The experiment results are showed in this repository. And the whole paper is under revision in Library Hi Tech.
